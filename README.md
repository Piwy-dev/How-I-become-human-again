# How I become human again:
## Presentation:
This game was made for "game jam confinement". It is a simple platform game where you play as a robot that has to collect its DNA that scientists have removed from it in order to perform an experiment. 
## Assets:
To make this game, I used these differents assets:
### Standart Asset from Unity:
The robot is a character available for free in the Unity asset store and more precisely in "Standart asset", created by Unity. I also used the basic platforms available in this asset. I made the other type of plaforms(faling plaforms, moving platforms, ...) myself.
